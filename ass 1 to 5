1) Reverse a String and print it on console
   "Java Skills"
package com.google;
/*
Author : Dhanashree
code for reverse a string
* */

public class Ass1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String myStr="JavaSkills";

        for(int i=myStr.length()-1; i>=0; i--)//last index of string is its length-1 and first index starts with o
        {
            System.out.print(myStr.charAt(i));
        }
    }
}
2)Assign String to x variable in DD-MM-YYYY format extract and print Year from String.
package com.google;
/*
Author : Dhanashree
code for extract year from date stored in string
* */

public class Ass2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String x="5-11-2003";
        // using split method on string object...it return array of splited characters
        String d=x.split("-")[0];// extract date
        String m=x.split("-")[1];// extract month
        String y=x.split("-")[2];// extract year

        System.out.println("Year : "+y);
    }
}
3)In a small company, the average salary of three employees is Rs1000 per week. If one employee earns Rs1100 and other earns Rs500, how much will the third employee earn? Solve by using java programm


package com.google;
/*
Author : Dhanashree
code for calculate salary of employee
* */
public class Ass3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int avgOfThreeEmpInOneWeek=1000; //We have given that average salary of 3 employees in one week is 1000
        int E1_Salary=1100;
        int E2_Salary=500;
        float E3_Salary; // we have to find third employee salary

        // we know 1000(avg)=(1100(E1)+500(E2)+E3) / 3 .....3 because there are 3 employees
        //E3 =  1000*3 / (1100+500)
        E3_Salary= (float) ((avgOfThreeEmpInOneWeek*3.0)/ (E1_Salary+E2_Salary));
        System.out.println("Salary of thid employee is: "+E3_Salary);
    }
}

4) Write Program - convert a percentage to a fraction (To convert a percentage into fraction let say 30% to a fraction)


package com.google;
/*
Author Dhanashree
code for convert percentage to fraction
* */

public class Ass4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int per=30; //percentage = 30%
        // To convert percentage into fraction simply remove % sign and divide that by 100
        // we can reduce fraction further
        int numerator=per;
        int denominator=100;
        // fraction = numerator / denominator
        System.out.println(" Fraction of "+ per+" % is: "+numerator+"/"+denominator);
        // to reuduce we can divide nume and denom by 10 ..both are divisible by 10..
        numerator=per/10;
        denominator=100/10;
        System.out.println(" Fraction of "+ per+" % is: "+numerator+"/"+denominator);


    }
5)Write Program - A train 340 m long is running at a speed of 45 km/hr. what time will it take to cross a 160 m long tunnel?

package com.google;
/*
Author : Dhanashree
code for calculate time duration in which a 340m
long train can pass 160m long tunnel at speed 45 km/hr
* */

public class Ass5 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int trainLength=340;//340 m long train
        double speed=45.0;//45 km/hr speed of train
        int tunnel=160; //160m long tunnel

        /*
        * Here we have given speed in km/hr and length of train and tunnel in m unit...
        * first we have to convert km/hr in m/s
        * 45 km/hr= 45* 1000/3600 m/s
        * Speed= 25/2 m/s
        * Total distance to cover (340+160)m= 500m
        * time = distance/speed
        *        500/ (25/2)
        *        500*(2/25)
        *        40 seconds
        * */

        speed=(double) speed*(1000/3600.0);
        int distance=tunnel+trainLength;
        double time=distance/speed;

        System.out.println(" Time required :"+ time+" Seconds");





    }
}
